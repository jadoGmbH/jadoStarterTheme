# ja.do WordPress Starter Theme

This is a super slim and fast Starter Theme for WordPress, Gutenberg enabled - integrated in style.css and fully responsive. 
jQuery is deactivated and two functions are integrated in pure JavaScript in the footer.php to get the burger-menu and the header behavior to work (sticky header).
