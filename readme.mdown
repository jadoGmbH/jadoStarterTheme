# ja.do WordPress Starter Theme

This is a slim starter Theme for WordPress, Gutenberg enabled but integrated in style.css, fully responsive and fast as hell. 
jQuery is deactivated and two functions are integrated in pure JavaScript in the footer.php to get the burger-menu and to handle the header behavior (fixed header).
